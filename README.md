This calculator can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It functions similarly to a simple hand held calculator that display only one number at a time. It shows the currently queued operator for an operation. It attempts to limit the number of decimals shown, but it is not well equipped for dealing with very large numbers.

It currently does not have a decimal button, negative number button, or backspace button.
